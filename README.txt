You must have your own key for Reddit for this code to work!

Hello, and welcome to our python web application that streamlines the Reddit experience for all users. We are proud to conclude that our project that we set our to build is quite operational.

What is this project?

This project allows users to use a reddit client built entirely out of python using flask, praw, oauth2, and several other libraries. It is a clean and simplified reddit experience that many people shall be able to use with greater ease than before. 

That's cool, but why?

Reddit is not always intuitive. It is a fairly complex website that many people do not bother to figure out how to use. In fact, before the project Yazmin had never used Reddit. This application streamlines that process by asking some simple questions.

>What subreddit?

>How many posts? 

>What type of posts?

With this information that we gather, we can find data with ease directly from the reddit website using the Reddit API and return the data in a better format.

Real World Applications?

>Can access all data from Reddit using API

>Excellent for those who have never used Reddit before

>Easy to understand and figure out how to use

>A web application that one can use on their mobile device

What can our team do going forward?

Our team can do many things with this project such as, 

>Create even more parameters for more precise data (but won’t be as simple…)

>Improve the experience by making even cleaner CSS, as well as smoother animations.

>Possibly grab statistics directly from Reddit and use them in the application.

What did the team learn in this project?

We learned how to use Flask with even greater ability than before, such as taking data from an HTML file given from the user/form, running the data though our python source file, and returning that data on another page for the user. We also learned about Python Reddit Application Wrapper or PRAW, which was a very interesting and useful library. This allowed us to get data from users with even greater ease and find the data we needed. Oauth2 was a great use when getting the secret code from Reddit that allowed us to use the API, and the application would certainly not work without the initial implementation of this library. Another helpful thing we learned as a team was how to convert our program into a class and use it in other files to get it to operate similar to a library. This made writing the program in our flask handler much more simple than just having floating functions in a file. This project taught us a lot in the duration we used it and we shall certainly be using the tools we learned here in the future. 

What was a huge difficulty in the project?

Yes, a major difficulty in the project was getting the API key from Reddit. This process is a pain at times as Reddit does not initially give you the secret client key that you need. The process for this required use of Oauth2 and finding the exact key that is need from a JSON response. Another thing that we had difficulty with was learning to take input from the user and giving them the data they wanted back. This was a tedious process as we had to convert our main file into a giant class. However, with all the troubles that this project caused us it taught us a lot and allowed us to learn even more with all the stumbles we came upon.

Awesome job guys! Did you do this all by yourself?

Well, we did not do this all by ourself as we researched and worked with 
alongside many useful tutorials available to everyone. They are very useful tutorials 
and I highly suggest that you check them out! Here are the websites that accessed 
and implemented in our project:

Thanks once again for resources that helped take this project off the ground kudos to them!


Once again, if there are any questions or concerns about our project feel free to 
contact Jeremy, Yazmin, or Jorge.

That's about all we have to say, I hope you enjoy the program.
Thanks!
